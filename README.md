***Traitly*** is an open-source Python tool for high-throughput fruit phenotyping that automatically extracts quantitative traits from digital images of fruit slices. It focuses on the phenotyping of internal fruit structures, using computer vision–based methods to quantify morphology, anatomy, symmetry, and color traits.

The tool supports both single-image and batch processing workflows, allowing users to analyze large image datasets with only a few lines of code, making it suitable for plant breeding and research.

> **Note**  
> A manuscript describing this software is currently under preparation and is expected to be released in **Spring-Summer, 2026**.

### What can Traitly do?

Traitly processes fruit images to measure:

* **Fruit morphology**: Area, perimeter, circularity, aspect ratio, and bounding box dimensions
* **Locule anatomy**: Locule number, size distribution, and spatial arrangement
* **Pericarp structure**: Thickness profiles, uniformity (CV), and surface irregularity (lobedness)
* **Color phenotypes**: Multi-channel analysis (RGB, HSV, Lab) across different fruit regions


**👉 For a complete list of extracted traits, see:** [Trait Tables](documentation.md)
